This JavaScript plugin acts as an alternative to the limiting and, often, confusing CSS properties for arranging content containers on web pages.

The plugin cannot replace all of CSS styling but it does allow for more granular control over how containers resize to fit the changing height and width of the browser window.

Here is one site that I built using this plugin:
